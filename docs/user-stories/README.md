## Epics

| Epic | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [Epic 001: Suggested Prompts & Transparent Memory](./epic-001-suggested-prompts.md) | Onboarding experience with intelligent prompts and user-visible memory | Draft |

## Design Principles

Our user stories are guided by these principles:

1. **Transparency First** - Users can always see what the system knows about them
2. **Progressive Intelligence** - Features start simple and grow smarter with use
3. **User Control** - Users can view, edit, export, and reset any stored data
4. **Portable Data** - Memory exports as standard .md files that work anywhere
5. **No Black Boxes** - The system explains its reasoning
6. **Zero Friction Start** - Works immediately without accounts or setup

## Target Audience

Individuals and small businesses looking to optimize day-to-day actions:
- Not developers (no git, no technical file management)
- Google/Microsoft users (familiar with Drive, OneDrive, Docs, Sheets)
- Productivity-focused (want tools that "just work")
